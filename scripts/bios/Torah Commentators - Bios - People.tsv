He wrote indispensible works of philosophy, Halacha, commentary, and responsa. Born in Spain, his family fled while he was still a youth. After an extended period in Morocco, he settled in Egypt, where he became Nagid (leader) of the Jewish community. His works were all foundational in their field. He was the first to produce a comprehensive commentary on the entire Mishnah. His great work of philosophy, Moreh Nevuchim, spawned an entire discipline and had incalculable influence upon enthusiastic promoters and vehement opponents alike. His code of law, Mishneh Torah, is the first and unsurpassed comprehesive code of Jewish law and practice. He also served as court physician to the Muslim leader Saladin. All of his works were written in Judeo-Arabic except for Mishneh Torah, which was written in a magnifient Hebrew. The precision of his expression is legendary.

His best-known work is Sha'arei Teshuva, a comprehensive work on repentence. He also wrote chiddushim (Talmudic novellae) on a number of tractates, quoted by contemporaries and later authors. He was one of the most prominent opponents of the Rambam's philosophical works. When the attacks on the Rambam's works culminated in a public burning of wagon-loads of Talmud by Christian authorities, Rabbeinu Yonah publicly admitted his error in involving outside players, and gave Rambam a prominent and revered place in his teaching. It is surmised that this turn of events motivated Rabbeinu Yonah to write Sha'arei Teshuva.		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonah_Gerondi	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%92%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%99	http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11129-moses-ben-nahman-gerondi									Ramban	M	Great Grand Father of Gershonides

Tosafot	Tosafot	Da'at Z'kenim	תוספות	דעת זקנים					Rishonim	The Tosafists - Ba'alei HaTosafot - were members of a school of Torah and Talmudic interpretation which flourished in 12th and 13th century France and Germany. Their roots are in the work of Rashi – in fact Rashi's sons-in-law and grandsons are counted amongst the founders and most influential members of the school of Tosafot. Their comments on almost every tractate of the Talmud were collected, edited, augmented and passed on for generations, with certain collections gaining more prominence (depending on tractate and locale). Their approach is analytical, comparative and incisive, and many times takes a critical stance regarding Rashi's commentary. They were amongst the first French and German rabbis to quote extensively the Jerusalem Talmud and the Talmud commentary of Rabbenu Chananel (of North Africa). Other works also emerged from their school, most notably Machzor Vitri and the Torah commentary, Da'at Z'kenim. 	בעלי התוספות (המאות ה-12 וה-13) ידועים בעיקר בזכות פירושם לתלמוד. דעת זקנים הוא פירוש לתורה שבדרך כלל מספק פירושי "פשט" לכתוב.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%AA	http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14457-tosafot#anchor43										M

He was a child prodigy and initially rejected many marriage offers to devote himself entirely to Torah study. After marrying, he moved to Pozen and established a yeshiva, which was supported for twenty years by his mother-in-law, Eidel. In gratitute of her unstinting support, he adopted her name as his surname.

In 1733, he left his native Morocco for the Land of Israel. On the way, he passed through Italy, where the community of Livorno pressed him to stay. He founded a yeshiva and had a number of his works printed, which gained him renown in Europe as well has his native Morocco. He eventually moved on to the Land of Israel, where he made a great impression on his student, Chida. His eponymous Torah commentary, Or HaChayyim, is most original, blending Kabbalistic teachings with deeply insightful and original readings. He was held in especially high esteem by the early Chassidim. 	רבי חיים בן עטר (נפטר 1743) היה פרשן תורה מרוקאי, פוסק הלכה ומקובל.

Born in Portugal, he displayed a great mastery of both Jewish and secular learning from his youth. His precocious abilities in financial matters attracted the attention of King Alfonso V of Portugal, who appointed him royal treasurer. He used his great wealth and position to help free Jews sold into slavery in Morocco. When Alfonso died in 1483 and Abarbanel was falsely accused, he fled for his life to Toledo in Castille, leaving behind a large fortune which had been confiscated. There he devoted himself to composing his famous Biblical commentary, but answer the call of Queen Isabella and contracted as supplier of the royal army and tax farmer, lending significant sums to help fund the Moorish war. When the Edict of Expulsion was issued, he strove mightily to have it rescinded, offering a forture to the crown, to no avail. He left with his brethern and settled in Naples. When that city was overtaken by the French, he again was forced to leave without his possessions, following his patron to Sicily, Corfu, and finally, to Venice. His apologetics works argued for the Jewish idea of the Mashiach, his exegetical works were unique in that they took social and political issues into consideration, and in his philosophical works he several criticisizes many of his Jewish philosophical predecessor.	אברבנאל (נפטר 1508) היה פרשן תנ"ך, פילוסוף ומדינאי. הוא נולד בפורטוגל, חי את רוב חייו בספרד ונפטר בוונציה. פירושו של אברבנאל תמיד מתחיל בכמה שאלות על הכתוב של אותו פרק, ועליהן הוא עונה במהלך פירושו.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abravanel	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9C	http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/631-abravanel-abarbanel					Joseph ibn Shem-Tov					M

Known as the "ilui (prodigy) of Volhynia," he served in seven different rabbinic posts over the course of his lifetime. His staunch adherence to halacha and defense of tradition put him in direct confrontation with "enlightened" intellectuals who wished to introduce Reformist innovations in worship and other communal institutions. While serving as chief rabbi of Bucharest, he was falsely charged by his opponents and he only escaped imprisonment on the condition that he leave Romania. Persecution by reformers followed him to other rabbinic posts, including Lunchitz, where he was additionally attacked by a Chassidic faction that accused him of introducing enlightenment thought in his Torah commentary. On his way to accept a post in Krementchug, he fell sick in Kiev and died on the first day of Rosh HaShanah.	רבי מאיר ליבוש וייזר, הידוע בכינויו המלבי"ם, היה מלומד, דורש ופרשן תורה שגר בכמה מקומות במזרח אירופה. המלבי"ם הוא פירוש לתורה שמנסה להגן על הגישה המסורתית ללימוד תורה מול החידושים של התנועה הרפורמית, ולהראות שהתורה שבעל פה נטועה עמוק בכתוב בתנ"ך.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%99%22%D7%9D	http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10325-malbim-meir-lob-ben-jehiel-michael					Leib of Volochisk					M

Radak himself participated in a number of public relilgious disputations to defend Judaism. He also took part in the disputes surrounding Rambam's philosophical works. Influenced by Ibn Ezra and the Rambam in philosophical matters, he sided the those who supported the permissibility of philosophic study. Radak cautioned, however, that it should be underaken only by those whose faith was well-grounded. His commentaries on Tanach display his grammatical mastery, and are amongst the most basic and and commonly referenced. 	רבי דוד קמחי (נפטר 1235) חי בצרפת היה ותלמיד חכם, פילוסוף ומדקדק. פירושו של רד"ק מתמקד הרבה בעניינים דקדוקיים ואטימולוגיים בתוך הפסוקים.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%93%22%D7%A7	http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9320-kimhi		Joseph Kimhi			Moses Kimhi					M	brother, Moses Kimhi

He was supported in his Torah education by his merchant father and later by his wife until, at the age of 40, he accepted a position as rabbi of Dvinsk. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of philosophical and kabbalistic literature, and his commentaries on Rambam's Mishneh Torah and on Chumash are noted for their originality and depth. His knowledge of the Jerusalem Talmud was so thorough that he was able to immediately determine that two supposedly "newly discovered" tractates were forgeries.

He seems never to have accepted a rabbinic post, and little is known about his life - even the place and date of his death is unclear. Ralbag was a strict Aristotalian, and in his great philosophical work, Milchamot Hashem, he critiques Rambam on some points where he deviates from Aristotalian teaching. He was also a fervant believer in astrology, and astrological determinism pervades his philosophical work, although he maintained the notion of human free-will. His philophical views lead to opposition to his works in some circles. His mathematical works were sophisticated, influential and ground-breaking - he is noted for his work in combinatorics and early use of the principle of mathematical induction - and some of these works were translated into Latin at the request of Christian scholars. He is also credited for inventing the Jacob's staff, an astronomical device. Finally, he is perhaps best known today for his commentary on the Tanach, which displays his wide learning and interweaves halakhic matters and rulings. He wrote several Talmudic works, most of which have been lost.	רבי לוי בן גרשון היה פילוסוף צרפתי, מתמטיקאי, אסטרולוג ופרשן תורה. פירוש רלב"ג לתורה כולל הסבר על המילים בכל פסוק, פירוש המשמעות שבו, וחקר המשמעויות העמוקות יותר והמסרים העולים מהכתוב.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9C%D7%91%22%D7%92	http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9813-levi-ben-gershon		Gerson ben Solomon Catalan								M

He served as head of two different yeshivot and, by his own testimony, devoted the overwhelming majority of his time to the study and teaching of halachah.  Only a few hours before Shabbat did he turn to preparing his famous sermons, attended by large throngs and eagerly repeated, in part or whole, without attribution. He therefore published them in the form of a Torah commentary to prevent others taking credit for his work and thereby committing the serious offense of Torah plagarism. He was one of the few scholars who received semichah (full rabbinic ordination) from his teacher, R. Yosef Karo, after it had been renewed by R. Yaakov Berav.

These sermons were collected and formed the basis of his masterwork, Akedat Yitzchak. Later, he served as chief rabbi in other cities. When Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492, he moved with his son, Meir, to Portugal, and, from there, to southern Italy. He greatly admired the Rambam, but felt that the philosophical commentators who succeed him took the Rambam's philosophical approach in directions he never intended. His teachings are brought so consistently, and often anonymously, by Abarbanel in his commentaries that Meir Arama accused him of plagarizing his father's works. 	הרב יצחק בן משה עראמה (נפטר 1494) חי בספרד והיה בעל גמרא ופרשן בעל נטייה פילוסופית.

He wrote copious commentaries on virtually all Jewish texts, including corrective notes on the Talmud. He also authored books on grammar and mathematics and encouraged his students to learn the secular sciences.  He may be best remembered as one of the leaders of the "Misnagdim," the opponents of the newly emergent Hasidic movement. He declared that the Hasidic belief in miracles and visions were lies and delusions and advocated a more rational approach to Torah observance that emphasized the traditional obligations of Torah study and fulfillment of the commandments.		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/הגאון_מווילנה	http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5651-elijah-gaon					Moses Margolies					M

He moved to Tzfat and Teveriah shortly after being ransomed from captivity in 1625, where he further immersed himself in kabbalist study. His great work, Shnei Luchot HaBrit, published by his son, is almost unparalleled in its impact on Ashkenazic Jewish life, playing an enormous role in spreading and popularizing Kabbalistic ideas.

Under his leadership, Chabad emerged from relative obscurity to become one of the most influential forces of Jewish life in the 20th century. Escaping Nazi Europe, he arrived in New York in 1941, where he became the head of Chabad's educational and social service networks. He immediately established the "shlichut" system, sending pairs of yeshiva students to far-flung Jewish communities to reconnect Jews to their heritage. He also worked actively internationally, helping to free thousands of Iranian Jews during the 1979 revolution, and later providing for the religious and educational needs of Jews trapped inside the Soviet Union. 		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson	https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9D_%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%9C_%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9F						Levi Yitzchak Schneerson, Zalman Vilenkin					M	Descendent of Zemah Zedek
