<h1>Jobs at Sefaria</h1>

<h2 id="content-engineer" class="anchorable">Junior Content Engineer</h2>

<p>Sefaria, the open digital platform for Jewish texts, seeks a driven individual to help expand our library of texts. This full-time, junior programmer will work on content-related tasks for our system. The role involves:</p>

<ul>
<li>Analyzing structures of texts and creating formal representations using Sefaria's toolset</li>
<li>Parsing text from various sources and loading them into Sefaria’s repository</li>
<li>Developing and improving tools used in content processing</li>
<li>Developing and improving algorithms used to find connections between different texts</li>
<li>Creating tools for non-technical power users to edit and manage large volumes of text</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Key Responsibilities:</h3>

<p>Sefaria’s database of texts currently contains more than 60 million words. We’re working through a roadmap to triple the size of the library by the end of 2018. Everything we obtain must be properly imported into our system. Our repository’s code base is Python running over MongoDB with a RESTful API. The process of parsing unstructured digital text generally involves analyzing the text to determine its structure, encoding that structure, writing custom scripts to convert the source text into the appropriate structure, and posting the resulting data to our server.</p>
