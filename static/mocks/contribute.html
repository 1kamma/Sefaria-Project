<h1>Contributing to Sefaria</h1>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span12">
		<p>If you can spare 10 minutes, you can bring one piece of Jewish learning into the Public Domain. Some contributions require scholarly knowledge; some are more like (holy) data-entry that anyone with an interest in Jewish texts can do. If you have any questions, please send an email to <a href="mailto:sefaria-contributors@googlegroups.com">sefaria-contributors@googlegroups.com</a>.</p>   

		<p>Here are 4 things that you can do right now to help. If you understand the kinds of things you can do, but need a suggestion of specifically wich texts to work on, see <a href="#focus">Focus Areas</a> below.</p>

		<h2>1. Add Connections</h2> 
	</div>
	<div class="span12">
		<p>Our tradition is full of connections between texts. We want to make a complete list of these connections in a form that a computer can understand. Any time Sefaria knows about connected texts, it shows a portion of the connected text on the right hand side of the screen.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span5">
			<p>You may be able to look up connections in resources like the Torah Temimah, or you may find a citation in a place like Wikisource and simply need to enter it.</p>
		<p>There are many types of connections we're looking for:</p>
		<dl class="dl-horizontal">
			<dt>Commentary</dt>
			<dd>One text explicitly comments on another.</dd>
			<dt>Quotation</dt>
			<dd>The words one text appear quoted in another.</dd>
			<dt>Allusion</dt>
			<dd>One text refers to another without quoting it explicitly.</dd>
			<dt>Context</dt>
			<dd>One text is an gives important context to understanding another.</dd>
			<dt>Comparison</dt>
			<dd>Two texts that are worth comparing to one another</dd>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="span7">
		<div class="howto well">
			<h3>How to add connections:</h3>
			<p>Adding a connectin is as simple as saying "Mishna Taanit 4:3 quotes Genesis 1:1."</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Open a text you want to add a connection to.</li>
				<li>Click the segment of text to connect then click <code>Add Source</code> (in the bottom right hand corner, or in the (+) menu that appears next to the highlighted text)</li>
				<li>Enter a specific citation for the text to connect to. Sefaria will guide you as you type to make sure it gets the information is needs in a form it can understand.</li>
				<li>If Sefaria doesn't have the text you want to connect, you'll need to add it first (see below). You won't have to enter the whole thing, only the part you want to connect.</li>

		<h2>2. Add Texts</h2>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
	<div class="span12">
		<p>Our goal is to include in Sefaria <i>all</i> of the primary texts of the Jewish tradition. This means Tanach, Midrash, Mishna, Gemara, Meforshim, Halacha, Kabalah, Chasidut, Machsheva, Musar and more.</p>
		<p>Some texts can be just be copy and pasted from other websites, other texts will need to be transcribed from a book. Sefaria is built to support <strong>fragments</strong>, so you don't have do everything at once or start at the beginning. Each small piece by itself is a step closer.</p>
		<p>It's imporant that Sefaria understand the correct <strong>structure</strong> of a text; that is, how it's divided up into appropriate subsections. For Tanach this means splitting it into "verses", for Mishna it's splitting it into "mishnas". Each text may have its own names for what these sections are called.</p>

		<div class="well howto">
		<h3>How to add texts:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Click <code>Add new text +</code> in the open menu at the top left.</li>

			<li>Type the name of the text you want to add. If Sefaria knows about the text already, it may replace what you write with a name variant that Sefaria considers to be the default.</li>

			<li>If Sefaria doesn't know anyting about the text yet, you'll have to the new describe the text first (see below).</li>

			<li>Follow the prompts that Sefaria gives to specify which part (chapter, page, section) of that text you want to add, then click <code>OK</code>.</li>

			<li>Assuming you are copying a text from a book or website, select <code>Copied Text</code>.</li>

			<li>Add a <code>Version Title</code>. This may be the website where the text came from (like "Wikisource Talmud") or the name of a historical translation (like "JPS 1917 Tanach").</li>

			<li>Add a <code>Source</code> for this version in the box that says "Copied from". For websites, this should be a web link to the text. For transcribed texts, this should be a citaton for the book you used to transcribe the text.</li>

			<li>Type or paste your text in the large box. Pay attention to the blue <span class="badge badge-info">Section Labels</span> that appear outside the text box. These labels show you how Sefaria will break up and number the segments of your text. You can hit <code>enter</code> or <code>backspace</code> to break up or put together your text until the labels are all correct.</li>

			<li>Click <code>Save</code> in the upper right hand corner when you're finished, then pat yourself on the back for making culture more freely available.</li>

		<h3 class="big">How exactly do I find the text I want to add?</h3>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Copy from Wikisource</h3>
		<p>Wikisource is the best collection on the web of primary texts available with a public licence. Most of the texts in Sefaria today come from Wikisource. You are free to copy and paste any texts from Wikisource into Sefaria so long as you indicate "Wikisource" as the version title and leave a link to the page you copied from. Look at <a href="http://he.wikisource.org">Hebrew Wikisource</a> for original texts and the <a href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Portal:Judaism">Judaism Portal</a> on English Wikisource for texts in translation.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Copy from Public Sources</h3>
		<p>There are plenty of other sources on the Net that publish their work with a public license or are already in the public domain (such as the <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/">Internet Sacred Text Archive</a>). If you find a text you'd like to copy, look for a Creative Commons license such as <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>, <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0">CC-BY</a>, or <a href="">CC-BY-SA</a>, or check this <a href="http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm">summary of Copyright Terms</a> to see if this text may already be in the public domain.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Transcribe from a Book</h3>
		<p>Until we have a perfect OCR system in place, picking up a book and transcribing what you see may still be the fastest way to bring some texts online. It may seem daunting, but every word you transcribe is a word that no one else ever has to transcribe again. If the text or translation in a book you have was written after 1923, please check this <a href="http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm">summary of Copyright Terms</a> before transcribing anything more than a quotation.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span6">
		<h3>Quote from Copyrighted Sources</h3>
		<p>Even if an source (whether a book or website) is under copyright, you may still copy a small porition of it to Sefaria. We believe creating an interactive experience out of many texts is a transformative use, which gives us protection under fair use, so long as large portions of copyrighted works are not copied. Of course you must name the source such a text was taken from and include a link to the page where it was found.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span12">
		<h2>3. Translate Texts</h2>
		<p>If you're comfortable translating Hebrew, creating new translations of classic texts and offering them to the world to view and use is an incredibly impactful way to share your skills. There's a huge opportunity here, because so much of the basics have yet to be started. You may find dozens of translations of Rashi on Tanach, but what about Rambam, Ibn Ezra or Sforno?</p>

		<p>Following the success of sites like Wikipedia and Wikisorce, Sefaria is adopting a collobarative approach. Anyone may start a new translation, and anyone else may step in to suggest improvements. As we grow we'll design systems for contributors to more thoroughly vett and approve new translations.</p>

		<p>For texts that we have in their original, Sefaria offers a simple side by side tool for making new translations.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="span12">
		<div class="howto well">
			<h3>How to add new translations:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Open the Hebrew or Aramaic of a text you want translate.</li>
				<li></li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>		
		</div>

<div class="row">
	<div class="span12">
		<h2>4. Describe Texts</h2>
		<p>Before Sefaria can store new texts and translatons, it need to know some basic information about the text. Aside from the text's title, the most important thing Sefaria needs to know is what the structure of the text is. This means knowing, for example, that the book of Bereshit is divided into chapters, and those chapters are divided into verses. A more complex work like the Mishneh Torah is composed of books, which are composed of topics, which are composed of chapters, which are composed of laws.</p>
		<p>Having clear list of texts, and knowing a lot about them, will make it easier for Sefaria to move forward, measure its progress and account for what's left to do.</p>
